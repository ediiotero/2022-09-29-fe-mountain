// Using the object below
// 1 console log the customer name
// 2 console log using a template literal "shipping to 123 Main street Gotham NY 12345" 
// 3 add a property of "orderNum" and set it to 111222, change age to 44, console.log the object

const customer = {
    name: "Toby",
    age: 32,
    address: {
        street: "123 Main street",
        city: "Gotham",
        state: "NY",
        zip: "12345"
    }
}



// ==================================

// Write a class for a Hero 
// - the Hero should have a property of name, health, and power
// - the Hero should also have a method of attack 
//   - attack should return power plus 5

// Write another class that will inherit Hero and call it Villain
// - the villain should have all the same properties as Hero
// - add a method call magic
//   - magic should return power multiplied by 2

// Create a hero and a villain and log out all of their properties

// *Bonus - Write a loop that will have the hero(use attack) and villain(use magic) attack each other 
//          reducing the amount of health left and console.log each round until health is at 0.
